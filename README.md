# LaunchOpenRGB

A script designed to be run as a Windows scheduled task. When started, it:

- copies your OpenRGB profile file to a backup directory (for easier backups)
- launches OpenRGB, applying your keyboard lighting settings profile
- stops OpenRGB after a safe-enough time when it's not needed any more
